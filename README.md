Learning Go programming
=======================  
  
My Exploratory journey on learning and mastering Go programming. 

How to run go project:  
---------------------  
+ Only one file say `main.go` can have `func main` declared.  
+ write go routines as necessary for your project and plan to call them from `main` function of `main.go`.  
+ Do `go run *.go` to run the whole project from terminal or build the project using `go build` and run the binary.
